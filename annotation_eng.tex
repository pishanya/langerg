This paper presents a formal discrete model of the endocrine islet of Langerhans based on a Moore machine, where the input signal is the quantized glucose level and the states correspond to the activity configurations of the $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\delta$-cells. It is shown that the proposed approach enables an unambiguous description of the key secretion modes of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin.
